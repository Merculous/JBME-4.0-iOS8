As of commit 360a6003e03f67faa66b2641e7e8da16ea280d06, so far I've tested
iPhone4,1. Only versions that are successfull are 8.4.1, 8.4, and 8.3.

I've tried using latest commit from jndok (4c47ead0385f03924c77ac17f3af66f19dcd6b05)
but for some reason instead of the above versions succeeding, literally all of them
failed to get offsets. find_allproc() MUST be updated to get all of the offsets.

Neat, the offsets needed to use HomeDepot jailbreak (iOS 8.4.1 version) via custom offsets for
iPhone4,1 on 8.3 jailbreaks the device :P I did try iPhone5,2 on 8.4 but it isn't working, so far.

Weird, seems like every time I mess with the way offsets are being parsed (before offsets were just
returned to be used later, now I use the offsets in a variable) breaks my offset parsing code to
fail when it worked without changing the way offsets are being handled. So, returning the raw offsets
to the offset parser gets it to the point where my print for it working has now changed when the data
is not returned, instead being passed as a variable which is written or parsed via the HomeDepot parser
makes the actual offset parser print that it failed when it should've printed that it worked.
