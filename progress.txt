Neat, the offsets needed to use HomeDepot jailbreak (iOS 8.4.1 version) via custom offsets for
iPhone4,1 on 8.3 jailbreaks the device :P I did try iPhone5,2 on 8.4 but it isn't working, so far.

Apparently, the api folder messes with getting offsets so in order to have stdout give us our offsets,
it needs to be removed before we start... WTF???
