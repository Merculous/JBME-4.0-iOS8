As of commit 360a6003e03f67faa66b2641e7e8da16ea280d06, so far I've tested
iPhone4,1. Only versions that are successfull are 8.4.1, 8.4, and 8.3.

I've tried using latest commit from jndok (4c47ead0385f03924c77ac17f3af66f19dcd6b05)
but for some reason instead of the above versions succeeding, literally all of them
failed to get offsets. find_allproc() MUST be updated to get all of the offsets.

Neat, the offsets needed to use HomeDepot jailbreak (iOS 8.4.1 version) via custom offsets for
iPhone4,1 on 8.3 jailbreaks the device :P I did try iPhone5,2 on 8.4 but it isn't working, so far.
